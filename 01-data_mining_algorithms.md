Algorithm selected: Decision Trees (within classification)

Words having trouble understanding:

1. Algorithm summary: Decision trees work by setting particular rules that lead to particular conditional probabilities

2. Data problem it solves: Can help with customer segmentation in bizdev / marketing.

3: Algorithm in layman's terms: There are a number of rules associated with the decision tree. These rules are associated with particular conditions and the program essentially decides which action to perform based on which line of conditional thinking it decides to go with.

4. 3 applications of the algorithm: 
	1) financial investments
	2) email marketing campaigns
	3) supply chain / raw material sourcing decisions
