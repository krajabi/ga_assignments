Duncan,

I am a huge fun of this project -- great work! You really break the problem and provide some interesting business insights that is tremendously helpful for AirBNB. It would have been interesting to see some visualizations other than the scatterplots, but the quality of the ones you provided are very compelling.

* Strengths of their project (things you particularly like about it)
-The organization of topics was brilliant -- you nicely told the story from start-to-finish
-The background + overview in the beginning is a wonderful introduction to your analysis. This may not have seemed like a huge effort but it's incredibly helpful for readers of your code to further understand the dataset and its integrity.
-The scatterplots are absolutely stunning. Fantastic use of visualizations.
-Fantastic explanation of your early observations within your project -- very easy to follow

* Comments about things you think could be improved
-Try conducting more quantitative analysis' before getting into the visualizations and various scatterplots
-Try to have more thorough analysis of the various features (ie. individual ratings)


* Questions about things you don't understand
-Were there other types of plots you could use for this dataset? Ex) potentially using bar and pie charts
-Why did you just do scatterplots for rating/room type?


* Comments about their code
-Brilliant your code into a dichotomy was pretty smart -- great approach to doing this!
-Try inserting comments into your analysis to describe what you're seeing as you go through your dataset (not just in its own section)


* Suggestions for next steps
-In your introduction, it would be helpful if you can map out to the reader what exactly they can expect to learn from your project
-Bring in a wider date range and see how the data has changed over time (I believe this was only 2015)
