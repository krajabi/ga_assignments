Houston,

This is a great start. It seems like you got a really solid groundwork down but may have spent more time overall setting up your project than doing some of the analysis' that would help you get some tangible conclusions. As such, I would highly recommend setting a hypothesis before you tackle your dataset so you can identify really what your ideal outcomes would be before committing 

* Strengths of their project (things you particularly like about it)
-You did a fantastic job integrating the API to work with your desired dataset
-I think you were on the right track with using a various types of visualizations to try depicting changes over time

* Comments about things you think could be improved
-When you're doing things like a describe on sports and non_sports, use comments to describe a little bit as to what you're seeing and conclusions you're drawing
-When you're doing dropna's, try to view your results along the way to ensure you completed your objectives corrently
-As you mentioned, many of the plots are pretty convoluted. Try to break the dataset into different groups so you know what subset is providing the analysis you're seeking

* Questions about things you don't understand
-why exactly did you do the venue ID groupby? 
-why did you do the plots the way you did?
-what exactly is your scatter matrix showing? Anything interesting in your opinion from it?

* Comments about their code
-the graphs are a little cluttered -- it would be much more insightful if you tried to break some of the lines into separate drawings
-after you did the advanced filtering, it would have been nice to see you a step further and potentially fish for quantitative associations

* Suggestions for next steps
-Take a step back before you begin your analysis and identify your strategy before proceeding forth
-Take some time to jot down your comments to describe what you're seeing and what limitations your dataset imposes
