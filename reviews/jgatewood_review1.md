James,

As you already know, I think overall did you an excellent job on this project!

Your analysis goal: Is there a correlation between the net worth of Condos and the amount of crime reported in a neighborhood?

* Strengths of their project (things you particularly like about it)
-Wonderful plots - great depiction of associations/correlations
-Wonderful organization - you really tell a compelling story and follow an organized procedure, systematically
-You did a very thorough and incisive overall analysis.

* Comments about things you think could be improved
-When cleaning up data, (if possible) it might save you some time to wipe some of the data on a CSV-reader rather than manual deletion and selection of individual columns
-Add other types of visualizations
-Use more comments in your code about the types of things you're seeing

* Questions about things you don't understand
-What are your biggest takeaways from the scatterplots you've created? Explain.
-What exactly does the quantile plot depict and what conclusion did you draw from it?
-Would love to learn more about the normal fit summary and what conclusions you drew from it.

* Comments about their code
-I'm a little skeptical about the integrity of the dataset. For example, in your neighboorhood comparision of average market value, some of the values seem pretty fishy: ex) East Harlem approximately on-par with Soho
-There seems to be a lot of various plots but I'd love to see some more focus on your original question/thesis. I'm wondering whether there are other associations you can explore that could signal a relationship with crime rate.

* Suggestions for next steps
-Analyze other factors and how they all may be inter-related to what you're trying to solve
-Assess similar data sets to see if there are underlying correlations you didn't realize
